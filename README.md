# DoFP-Interpolation-PDCNN
Convolution neural network for DoFP demosaicing or interpolation


These are the training and test codes for PDCNN proposed in the paper "Learning a convolutional demosaicing network for microgrid polarimeter imagery". The download link isï¼š https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-43-18-4534


The code is implemented based on Tensorflow.
To train, please run backward.py
To test, please run test.py
